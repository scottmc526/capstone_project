# Learn to score in bowling
This is my capstone project for Galvanize. The app is made to help someone who is new or someone who never learned how a bowling score is calculated. The scores are a little different than what you would see in a bowling alley as it shows the total for each frame in the scorecard rather than a running total. You can also log in and save your scores and go to a profile page that shows all the games you have saved and a running average. There also is a scoreboard feature that uses sockets. The idea behind this that you can compete against a friend that you may be physically with.

# To get the app running:
1. Fork and clone this repo
2. cd in the directory and npm install

# Deployed version:
